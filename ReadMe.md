Over the past months I developed my own tools to *little planets* images.

To run this code you will need to have:
+ some Python 2.7.12 for now
+ some modules such as the one here *little_planet_tools
+ hugin installed somewhere to be able to call is by script
+ imagemagick is a plus as I'm using a a lot to generate contact sheet
+ and some other stuffs I will add later
