A beautiful piece of code and of course everything is relative.

# The famous content

Over the past months I developed my own tools to work on  *little planets* images.

To run this code you will need to have:
+ some Python 2.7.12 for now
+ some modules such as the one here *little_planet_tools*
+ [hugin][link-hugin] installed somewhere to be able to call is by script
+ [imagemagick][link-imagemagick]  is a plus as I'm using a a lot to generate contact sheet
+ [opencv][link-opencv] can be a good idea to have it installed somewhere
+ and some other stuffs I will add later
