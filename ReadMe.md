# What do you need to use this code?

To run this code you will need to have:
+ some Python 2.7.12 for now
+ some modules such as the one here *little_planet_tools*
+ [hugin][link-hugin] installed somewhere to be able to call is by script
+ [imagemagick][link-imagemagick]  is a plus as I'm using a a lot to generate contact sheet
+ [opencv][link-opencv] can be a good idea to have it installed somewhere
+ and some other stuffs I will add later

Over the past months I developed my own tools to work on  **little planets** images.

The code is available is split into modules that answer questions I was asking to myself: *how can I simply generate little planets from an equi-rectangular panoramic picture*?

The operation can be listed as follows:

1. create a **pto** configuration file with **distance**, **angle** and **image output size**
2. apply the configuration file
3. look at the resulting **little planet**
4. restart operation 1 to 3 until satisfied with how look the **little planet**
5. export **little planet** with latest **angle** and **distance** parameters values and a larger **image output size** for ideally printing it later.
