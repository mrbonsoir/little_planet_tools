## To do in a near future to improve the bazar

The improvements can be brought on different aspect:

- easiness to generate little planets
- easiness to show new little planets
- detect automatically most important colors to the color stripes or circles accordingly
- create a proper requirement.txt for the python modules

The main idea is to have only to set **angle** and **distance** parameters when a new planet is generated. The colors for the stripes and/or circles could be automatically selected.

Concretely you have a python module called **little_planet_tools** that you can use to generate **little planet** images.

Below an attempt to keep track on the modifications I want to add to my code.

To do | in process | done for good
--- |:---:|:---:
configuration file **pto** to generate a **littple planet** | | x
better color stripes/circles generation | x  |
add more fancy pattern | x |
create contact sheet | x | 
create a *how to generate little planet* | x |
find the most common colors | x |
